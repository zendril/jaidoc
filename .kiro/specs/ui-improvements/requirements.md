# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the user experience of the Jaidoc documentation interface by implementing three key UI enhancements: making the application title clickable to navigate home, displaying shortened file paths on the index page, and preventing the search box from automatically stealing focus to allow proper text selection and copying.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing documentation, I want to click on the "Jaidoc" title in the upper left to return to the index page, so that I can easily navigate back to the main documentation overview from any page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the "Jaidoc" title in the left sidebar THEN the system SHALL navigate to the index.html page
2. WHEN the user hovers over the "Jaidoc" title THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator that it is clickable (cursor pointer)
3. WHEN the user is already on the index page and clicks the "Jaidoc" title THEN the system SHALL remain on the index page without causing any errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the index page, I want to see shortened file paths for main program files, so that I can quickly identify files without being overwhelmed by long absolute paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index page displays main program files THEN the system SHALL show relative paths starting from the project root instead of full absolute paths
2. WHEN a file path is "C:/devhome/projects/github/zendril/jaidoc/src/sample/sample.jai" THEN the system SHALL display "src/sample/sample.jai"
3. WHEN displaying shortened paths THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the path format used on individual file pages
4. WHEN the project root cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL fall back to displaying the filename only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reading documentation, I want the search box to not automatically steal focus, so that I can select and copy text from the documentation without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads THEN the search input SHALL NOT automatically receive focus
2. WHEN a user clicks directly on the search input THEN the system SHALL give focus to the search input
3. WHEN a user is selecting text on the page THEN the search input SHALL NOT interrupt the text selection by stealing focus
4. WHEN a user types while not focused on the search input THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect keystrokes to the search input
5. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN the search input SHALL NOT automatically receive focus on the new page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using Jaidoc for my project, I want to customize the application title that appears in the upper left corner, so that the documentation reflects my project's name instead of always showing "Jaidoc".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a custom title via command line argument THEN the system SHALL display that title instead of "Jaidoc" in the left sidebar
2. WHEN a user provides a custom title via module configuration THEN the system SHALL use that title across all generated documentation pages
3. WHEN no custom title is provided THEN the system SHALL default to displaying "Jaidoc" as the title
4. WHEN the custom title is provided THEN the system SHALL maintain the clickable functionality to navigate to the index page
5. WHEN the custom title contains special characters THEN the system SHALL properly escape them for HTML display
